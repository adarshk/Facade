<br/>
StoryBlocks is a flow based environment to create interactive webpages by dragging and dropping components. Its aimed at journalists/independent bloggers however the low technical entry point means that any user is able to create webpages regardless of their technical skill level. 
<br/>

The main principle behind the project is the fact that todays websites are fundamentally dynamic in nature. And therefore the project treats **interactions** as first class citizens.

Currently the following are supported:

1. Graphs/Charts
2. Images
3. Video
4. Text
5. Graphics (2D and 3D coming soon)

Interactions:

1. User click
2. Animations
3. Timeline
4. Transitions
5. Connected events

###FAQ###
<br/>

1. What level of technical knowledge is required to use this tool? <br/> A. StoryBlocks abstracts away things like graphs, charts and graphics and provides a low barrier to entry ideally making it really simple to use.  
2. How is this different from things like webflow.com or other similar tools? <br/>A. Whereas the aim of webflow and others is to try to abstract away programming for people, StoryBlocks brings the [flow based programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming) paradigm to creating webpages. Its a different way of thinking about interactions and interfaces.
